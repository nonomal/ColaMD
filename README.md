# ColaMD

> A free, elegant Markdown editor anyone can pick up. No toolbars, no clutter, and the file on disk is always what you see.

**Language / 语言: [English](README.md) · [中文](README_CN.md)** · [Website](https://colamd.com/)

ColaMD is an open-source, free, elegant Markdown editor for writing, notes, and documentation. It is built for people who just want to write: no toolbars, no status bar, nothing to configure: the window holds a title bar, your text, and a file list.

It offers true WYSIWYG editing, 12 built-in themes, rich-text copy, smart line breaks, search and replace, a document outline, PDF / HTML / Word export, and support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Whatever writes the file (an AI agent such as Claude Code or Codex, a script, or another editor), ColaMD shows the new content right away. No reopening, no manual refresh.

## Features

- **Always in Sync**: Whenever the file changes on disk (an AI agent, a script, another editor), the editor updates immediately. No reopening, no manual refresh.
- **True WYSIWYG Editing**: Type Markdown and see rich text directly. No split-pane preview.
- **Files & Outline**: Browse Markdown files in the selected folder, or switch to a document outline for focused heading navigation.
- **Source Mode**: Switch to the raw Markdown source whenever you need to inspect or edit it directly.
- **Task Lists**: Click checkboxes to complete tasks, or use the keyboard shortcut.
- **Highlights & LaTeX**: Write `==highlighted text==` and render mathematical formulas with KaTeX.
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Mermaid code blocks render as diagrams in an isolated hidden iframe with strict parsing; click a diagram to edit its source.
- **Search & Replace**: Find anything in the current document with ⌘/Ctrl+F, then replace the current match or all matches.
- **Smart Line Breaks**: Single newlines render as line breaks, matching how people and AI tools write Markdown.
- **Rich Text Copy**: Copy content with formatting preserved into WeChat, email, and other rich-text editors.
- **Themes**: Twelve built-in themes for focused writing in light or dark environments.
- **Recent Files & Session Restore**: Jump back to the last 10 documents from the File menu, and reopen where you left off at launch.
- **Editor Font Settings**: Pick any installed system font and size for the editor; your choice wins over theme defaults.
- **Multiple Windows**: Independent editor windows, each with its own save queue and close protection.
- **Save Status Hint**: A quiet titlebar indicator shows unsaved/saved, then fades away.
- **Heading Anchors**: Click intra-document anchor links to jump between headings, CJK included.
- **Version Changelog**: The first launch after an update opens the built-in changelog once, so you can see what changed without repeated prompts.
- **PDF, HTML & Word Export**: Turn your Markdown document into a themed PDF, self-contained HTML, or editable Word document.
- **Reading-Page Image Export**: Share Markdown as desktop or mobile PNG pages; longer documents continue as numbered pages.
- **Portable Image Paths**: Local images use safe `file://` URLs for display and return to relative paths when saved.
- **VS Code Integration**: Open the current Markdown file in ColaMD directly from VS Code.
- **Minimal by Design**: No toolbar, no permanent sidebar, no distractions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Works with your Markdown workflow

ColaMD does not ask you to change your habits. It works well alongside Obsidian, Typora, VS Code, and other Markdown apps, all sharing the same `.md` files, with each tool doing what it does best.

- v2.0.4: PDF export no longer captures app overlays, undo can no longer cross documents, rich-text copy no longer adds blank lines in chat apps, source mode no longer overflows with the file panel open, a reveal-in-file-manager action next to the document title, and the heuristic agent activity dot removed
- v2.0.3: Find & replace, UI language switch, large-document source-mode fallback, update download progress with retry, and differential (blockmap) updates
- Future: More themes, editor integrations, and smoother Markdown workflows
